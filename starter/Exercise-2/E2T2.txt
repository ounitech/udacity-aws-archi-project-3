Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- Inspector shows that scanning of all ports is possible on the RecipeWebServiceInstance from Internet
- Inspector shows that port 22 is accessible on the AttackInstanceSG from Internet
- AWS Config warns about non server side encryption for S3 Buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Delete Rule in WebAppSG that enable access to all ports from all sources
- Edite Rule in WebAppSG so that only port 5000 is accessible and only from AppLoadBalancerSG
- WebAppSG is hidden by AppLoadBalancer. Therefore, it does need to reside on a public subnet. It should be moved to a private subnet with no access to internet.
- An ACL should be used for the VPC
- S3 buckets should at least use server side encryption
