# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- move WebApp to a private subnet with no access to internet via gateway
- use an ACL that allow only ingress traffic to port 80 on  public subnet
- setup a distinct role for each bucket : the secret and the free
- create a vpn endpoint for privileged users and assign them a role


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- No, since the attacker who gain access to WebApp will inherit the connectivity to S3 buckets

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, according to documentation, only new objects will be encrypted. Old objects would not benefit from encryption and a work-around like copying them again should be done.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- All manual changes via console or cli will be deleted
